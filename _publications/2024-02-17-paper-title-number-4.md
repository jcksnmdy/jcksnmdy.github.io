excerpt: 'In this project we were tasked with making a temperature sensing and transmitting system that can operate on its own. It would essentially act as a forest fire detection system with the input voltage representing the “sun” from a solar panel. To achieve this goal, we had to first design a DC/DC converter to boost input voltage. The boost converter in turn powers a battery that provides power to the system when there was no input voltage, or “sunlight.” The rest of the system consists of a thermistor to get the temperature and a Bluetooth module to transmit it. When the input voltage, “sun” goes away, the system will enter sleep mode and wake up every 100 seconds to transmit the temperature and check if the sun is back out. '
