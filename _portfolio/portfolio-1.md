title: "Galactic Golf"
excerpt: "A combination of Python, Raspberry Piâ€™s, Arduinos, LEDs and sensors to sync identical targets of lights and interact with golf balls. Connected on a mesh network that spanned up to 400 yards between nodes. They each consisted of 6 individually controlled LED strips connected to some MOSFETs and Arudinos to change the colors. The targets reacted to golf balls landing on them and I had the ability to program the LEDs to create a light show synced to music using the Raspberry Pis.<br/><img src='/images/golf.png'>"
